<h1 class="unnumbered" id="elements-of-style-for-proofs">Elements of
Style for Proofs</h1>
<p>This work is an adaptation of <em>The Elements of Style for
Proofs</em> written by Anders Hendrickson. This version is currently
maintained by <a href="http://danaernst.com">Dana C. Ernst</a>.</p>
<p>Mathematics is about discovering proofs and writing them clearly and
compellingly. The following guidelines apply whenever you write a proof.
Keep these guidelines handy so that you may refer to them as you write
your proofs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The burden of communication lies on you, not on your
reader.</strong> It is your job to explain your thoughts; it is not your
reader’s job to guess them from a few hints. You are trying to convince
a skeptical reader who does not believe you, so you need to argue with
airtight logic in crystal clear language; otherwise the reader will
continue to doubt. If you did not write something on the paper, then (a)
you did not communicate it, (b) the reader did not learn it, and (c) the
grader has to assume you did not know it in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tell the reader what you are proving or citing.</strong>
The reader does not necessarily know or remember what “Theorem 2.13” is.
Even a professor grading a stack of papers might lose track from time to
time. Therefore, the statement you are proving should be on the same
page as the beginning of your proof.</p>
<p>In most proofs you will want to refer to an earlier definition,
problem, theorem, corollary, or lemma. In this case, you should
reference the statement by number, but it is also helpful to the reader
to summarize the statement you are citing. For example, you might write
something like, “By Theorem 2.3, the sum of two consecutive integers is
odd, and so…."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use English words.</strong> Although there will usually
be equations or mathematical statements in your proofs, use English
sentences to connect them and display their logical relationships. If
you at proofs in textbooks and research papers, you will see that they
consist mostly of English words.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use complete sentences.</strong> If you wrote a history
essay in sentence fragments, the reader would not understand what you
meant; likewise in mathematics you must use complete sentences, with
verbs, to convey your logical train of thought.</p>
<p>Some complete sentences can be written purely in mathematical
symbols, such as equations (e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(a^3=b^{-1}\)</span>), inequalities (e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(x&lt;5\)</span>), and other relations (like <span
class="math inline">\(5\big|10\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(7\in\mathbb{Z}\)</span>). These statements usually
express a relationship between two mathematical <em>objects</em>, like
numbers or sets. However, it is considered bad style to begin a sentence
with symbols. A common phrase to use to avoid starting a sentence with
mathematical symbols is “We see that...”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show the logical connections among your
sentences.</strong> Use phrases like “Therefore”, “Thus",”Hence",
“Then",”since", “because”, “if…, then…”, or “if and only if” to connect
your sentences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know the difference between statements and
objects.</strong> A mathematical object is a <em>thing</em>, a noun,
such as a set, an element, a number, an ordered pair, a vector space,
etc. Objects either exist or do not exist. Statements, on the other
hand, are mathematical <em>sentences</em>: they are either true or
false.</p>
<p>When you see or write a cluster of math symbols, be sure you know
whether it is an object (e.g., “<span
class="math inline">\(x^2+3\)</span>”) or a statement (e.g., “<span
class="math inline">\(x^2+3&lt;7\)</span>”). One way to tell is that
every mathematical statement includes a verb, such as <span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\in\)</span>, “divides”, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>**The symbol “<span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>” means
“equals".** Do not write <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span> unless
you mean that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> actually equals
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This guideline seems obvious,
but there is a great temptation to be sloppy. In calculus, for example,
some people might write <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^{2}=2x\)</span> (which is false), when they
really mean that”if <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^{2}\)</span>,
then <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;(x)=2x\)</span>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not interchange <span
class="math inline">\({=}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\({\Longrightarrow}\)</span>.</strong> The equals
sign connects two <em>objects</em>, as in “<span
class="math inline">\(x^2=b\)</span>”; the symbol “<span
class="math inline">\(\Longrightarrow\)</span>” is an abbreviation for
“implies” and connects two <em>statements</em>, as in “<span
class="math inline">\(a+b=a \Longrightarrow b=0\)</span>.” You should
avoid using <span class="math inline">\(\Longrightarrow\)</span> in
formal write-ups of proofs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid logical symbols in your proofs.</strong> Similar to
<span class="math inline">\(\Longrightarrow\)</span>, you should avoid
using the logical symbols <span class="math inline">\(\forall, \exists,
\vee, \wedge\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\Longleftrightarrow\)</span> in your formal
write-ups. These symbols are useful for abbreviating in your scratch
work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Say exactly what you mean.</strong> Just as <span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span> is sometimes abused, so too people
sometimes write <span class="math inline">\(A\in B\)</span> when they
mean <span class="math inline">\(A\subseteq B\)</span>, or write <span
class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\in A\)</span> when they mean that <span
class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span> is an entry in matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Mathematics is a very precise
language, and there is a way to say exactly what you mean; find it and
use it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not utilize anything unproven.</strong> Every
statement in your proof should be something you <em>know</em> to be
true. The reader expects your proof to be a series of statements, each
proven by the statements that came before it. If you ever need to write
something you do not yet know is true, you <em>must</em> preface it with
words like “assume,” “suppose,” or “if” if you are temporarily assuming
it, or with words like “we need to show that” or “we claim that” if it
is your goal. Otherwise, the reader will think they have missed part of
your proof.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write strings of equalities (or inequalities) in the
proper order.</strong> When your reader sees something like <span
class="math display">\[A=B\leq C=D,\]</span> they expect to understand
easily why <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span>, why <span
class="math inline">\(B\leq C\)</span>, and why <span
class="math inline">\(C=D\)</span>, and they expect the point of the
entire line to be the more complicated fact that <span
class="math inline">\(A\leq D\)</span>. For example, if you were
computing the distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the
point <span class="math inline">\((12,5)\)</span> from the origin, you
could write <span class="math display">\[d = \sqrt{12^2+5^2} =
13.\]</span> In this string of equalities, the first equals sign is true
by the Pythagorean theorem, the second is just arithmetic, and the
conclusion is that the first item equals the last item: <span
class="math inline">\(d=13\)</span>.</p>
<p>A common error is to write strings of equations in the wrong order.
For example, if you were to write “<span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=13=d\)</span>”, your reader would
understand the first equals sign, would be baffled as to how we know
<span class="math inline">\(d=13\)</span>, and would be utterly
perplexed as to why you wanted or needed to go through <span
class="math inline">\(13\)</span> to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=d\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid circularity.</strong> Be sure that no step in your
proof makes use of the conclusion!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not write the proof backwards.</strong> Beginning
students often attempt to write “proofs” like the following, which
attempts to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\tan^2(x)  =
\sec^2(x) - 1\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\tan^2(x) &amp; = \sec^2(x) - 1 \\
\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right)^2 &amp; = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} - 1
\\
\frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} &amp; =  \frac{1-\cos^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} \\
\sin^2(x) &amp; = 1-\cos^2(x) \\
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) &amp; = 1 \\
1 &amp; = 1
\end{align*}\]</span> Notice what has happened here: the student
<em>started</em> with the conclusion, and deduced the true statement
“<span class="math inline">\(1=1\)</span>.” In other words, they have
proved “If <span class="math inline">\(\tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x) -
1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(1=1\)</span>,” which is
true but highly uninteresting.</p>
<p>Now this is not a bad way of <em>finding</em> a proof. Working
backwards from your goal often is a good strategy <em>on your scratch
paper</em>, but when it is time to <em>write</em> your proof, you have
to start with the hypotheses and work to the conclusion.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a suitable proof for the desired result, where
each expression follows from the one immediately proceeding it: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\sec^2(x) - 1 &amp; = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} - 1\\
&amp; = \frac{1-\cos^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} \\
&amp; = \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right)^2 \\
&amp; = \left(\tan(x)\right)^2 \\
&amp; = \tan^2(x).
\end{align*}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be concise.</strong> Many beginning proof writers err by
writing their proofs too short, so that the reader cannot understand
their logic. It is nevertheless quite possible to be too wordy, and if
you find yourself writing a full-page essay, it is possible that you do
not really have a proof, but just some intuition. When you find a way to
turn that intuition into a formal proof, it will be much
shorter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce every symbol you use.</strong> If you use the
letter “<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>,” the reader should know
exactly what <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is. Good phrases for
introducing symbols include “Let <span class="math inline">\(n\in
\mathbb{N}\)</span>,” “Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be the
least integer such that…,” “For every real number <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>…,” and “Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\ldots\)</span>".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use appropriate quantifiers (once).</strong> When you
introduce a variable <span class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>, it
must be clear to your reader whether you mean “for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>” or just “for some <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>.” If you just say something like
“<span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>,” the word “where” does not
indicate whether you mean “for all” or “some”.</p>
<p>Phrases indicating the quantifier “for all” include “Assume <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for every <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for each <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”; etc. Phrases indicating the
quantifier “some” or “there exists”) include “for some <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “there exists an <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for a suitable choice of <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”; etc.</p>
<p>Once you have said “Assume <span class="math inline">\(x\in
S\)</span>,” the letter <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has its
meaning defined. You do not need to say “for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>” again, and you definitely should
<em>not</em> say “assume <span class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span>”
again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a symbol to mean only one thing.</strong> Once you
use the letter <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> once, its meaning
is fixed for the duration of your proof. You cannot use <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to mean anything else. There is an
exception to this guideline. Sometimes a proof will include multiple
subproofs that are distinct from each other. In this case, you can reuse
a variable or symbol as long as it is clear to the reader that you have
concluded with the previous subproof and have moved onto a new
subproof.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not “prove by example.”</strong><span id="pfbyexample"
data-label="pfbyexample"></span> Most problems ask you to prove that
something is true “for all”—You <em>cannot</em> prove this by giving a
single example, or even a hundred. Your proof will need to be a logical
argument that holds for <em>every example there possibly could
be</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the claim that you are trying to prove involves
the existence of a mathematical object with a particular property, then
providing a specific example is sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write “Let <span class="math inline">\(x=\dots\)</span>,”
not “Let <span class="math inline">\(\dots=x\)</span>.”</strong> When
you have an existing expression, say <span
class="math inline">\(a^{2}\)</span>, and you want to give it a new,
simpler name like <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, you should
write “Let <span class="math inline">\(b=a^{2}\)</span>,” which means,
“Let the new symbol <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> mean <span
class="math inline">\(a^{2}\)</span>.” This convention makes it clear to
the reader that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the brand-new
symbol and <span class="math inline">\(a^{2}\)</span> is the old
expression he/she already understands.</p>
<p>If you were to write it backwards, saying “Let <span
class="math inline">\(a^{2}=b\)</span>,” then your startled reader would
ask, “What if <span class="math inline">\(a^{2}\neq
b\)</span>?”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make your counterexamples concrete and specific.</strong>
Proofs need to be entirely general, but counterexamples should be
concrete. When you provide an example or counterexample, make it as
specific as possible. For a set, for example, you must specify its
elements, and for a function you must specify the corresponding relation
(possibly an algebraic rule) and its domain and codomain. Do not say
things like “<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> could be one-to-one
but not onto”; instead, provide an actual function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that is one-to-one but not
onto.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not include examples in proofs.</strong> Including an
example very rarely adds anything to your proof. If your logic is sound,
then it does not need an example to back it up. If your logic is bad, a
dozen examples will not help it (see Guideline <a href="#pfbyexample"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="pfbyexample">[pfbyexample]</a>). There are only two
valid reasons to include an example in a proof: if it is a
<em>counterexample</em> disproving something, or if you are performing
complicated manipulations in a general setting and the example is just
to help the reader understand what you are saying.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use scratch paper.</strong> Finding your proof will be a
long, potentially messy process, full of false starts and dead ends. Do
all that on scratch paper until you find a real proof, and only then
break out your clean paper to write your final proof carefully.</p>
<p>Only sentences that actually contribute to your proof should be part
of the proof. Do not just perform a “brain dump,” throwing everything
you know onto the paper before showing the logical steps that prove the
conclusion. <em>That is what scratch paper is for.</em></p></li>
